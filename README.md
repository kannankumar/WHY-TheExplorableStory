## The Story
Once there was a stubborn little girl whose favourite animal was the unicorn. She knew they existed because she’d seen a unicorn horn hanging on a museum wall when she was 3. 

As she grew, she started to look for unicorns wherever she went, taking pictures and recording the other things she found along the way. She looked high and low but couldn’t find any in her garden. So she looked further afield.

And further, but still found no evidence of the beautiful creatures of which she dreamed.

When she was older, she became a scientist and despite being an excellent scientist, this was a cover story because, deep down, all she wanted was to find her unicorn.

She travelled as far as she could on land and crossed the frozen seas to investigate more, but still to no avail. 

She looked under the waves, where she found their cousins. But that wasn’t good enough, she already knew narwhals existed!

After searching the atmosphere, she realised she had been wrong all along. Not believing in unicorns, but in the places she had been searching. 

So she worked harder than she had ever worked before and pushed her body to extremes. Until one day she strapped herself into a rocket and flew to the moon. Only to find that there were no unicorns there either! 

She bounced back to her craft, wondering what to do. 

She sat, while minutes became hours and hours became days. Then looked out into the darkness and she remembered the twinkling specks of hope that filled the night skies back on Earth. She couldn’t give up. So on she went, drifting through the vacuum.

She travelled beyond the reaches of the Earth’s technologies, so we will never know if she found evidence of her unicorns.

Perhaps her quest was misinformed, but she went anyway; finding some truly inspirational things along the way. We will never know what is out there until we go. This is why the reason we explore is unimportant: exploration is not simply to find one thing, but to see what else is there.

What’s your unicorn?

The end!
